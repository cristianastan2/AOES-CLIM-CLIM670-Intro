### Description of Project
In this class, you will work with prepared datasets and be expected to apply what you learn to your own dataset.  You will complete a class project that involves application of the skills from this class to a climate dataset of your own choosing.  The project will consist of:

* A Github repository of your data analysis with this dataset in which changes are tracked weekly via commits and pull requests (don't worry we will learn how to do this in class)
* The code repository should be well documented and fully reproducible such that I can get your code and reproduce your analysis without changing anything and I can understand you code well enough to apply it to a different dataset.
* Creating a website of your analysis using Github (we will how to do this in class)

The weekly assignments will take you step-by-step to the completion of the project based on what we learn in class that week.

### Dataset Requirements
It is highly reccomended that you choose a dataset that is relevant to your graduate research. If you are not yet working with a dataset in your research, you should first speak with your advisor to see they can reccomend a dataset to you. If your advisor cannot reccomend a dataset, please let me know and I will suggest one.

* The dataset must be a gridded dataset from a model, reanalysis, or observations.
* The dataset may be stored as a single file or multiple files.
* The dataset must contain a multiple time entries.
* The dataset must be defined on a latitude-longitude grid (can be regular or irregular)
* You must be able to explain where the dataset came from and how it was constructed/created.
* The dataset must be stored in a format such as netCDF, grib, hdf, or other self-describing format. 

Please check with me if you are not sure if your dataset meets the requirements or you need assistance finding a dataset.

> ## Start Thinking about your Dataset
>
> Type questions you have about the project or dataset requirements
> Type some potential datasets and what you already know about them.
> If you are not sure, type some climate related topics of interest to you that may help us identify a dataset.
