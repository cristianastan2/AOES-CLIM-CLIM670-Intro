### Materials

* Your computer (a tablet will not be sufficient)
* Access to Canvas. <a href="https://lms.gmu.edu/getting-started-students/"> Need help with Canvas?</a>
* GMU Computer Account [we will take care of this together during the first week of class]. You can also visit the <a href="https://orc.gmu.edu/new-user-information/"> Office of Research Computing (ORC) website</a> and click on “ORC Account Request Form”.
* NCAR Computer Account [we will take care of this together during the first week of class]
* There is no required book for this course. Course materials are available on GitHub. <a href="https://cristianastan2.github.io/AOES-CLIM670-Earth-System-Modeling/"> https://cristianastan2.github.io/AOES-CLIM670-Earth-System-Modeling</a>


### Best ways to contact me

1. _Canvas Discussion Forum_: For general questions, problems, etc. addressed to the other students as well as instructors. 
2. _Email_: For questions directed only to the instructor. I typically respond to emails within 24hrs during the work week and on Mon morning for emails that arrive over the weekend.  If you have not heard a response by this time, then I may not have received your email, so please re-send.
3. _Office Hours_: Please email me if you wish to meet individually and we will schedule a time to meet in person or via Canvas Zoom.

### Class Attendance

This is a face-to-face course. It is in your best interest to attend class during the scheduled class time - please don’t be late.

_Live Coding_: One of the reasons you should attend class in person is that this class will utilize a methodology called “Live Coding”.  This means you will follow along with me while I share and write code on the screen and explain the code as I go.  There will be no powerpoint presentations. This method is shown to be effective because it slows down the pace so everyone can keep up, forces me to take the time to explain what I am doing, helps you get accustomed to running codes yourself on your computer setup, and lets you see me make mistakes and how to correct them.

#### _If you miss class_

I understand, however that there can be various reasons for missing class and that connectivity issues do occur if trying to attent remotely.  If you miss class for whatever reason, all the information will be available to you on the course Canvas site, including:
* Class materials, including hands-on activities, which are publicly available via Github <a href="https://cristianastan2.github.io/AOES-CLIM670-Earth-System-Modeling/"> https://cristianastan2.github.io/AOES-CLIM670-Earth-System-Modeling</a>.
* All assignments will be posted to Canvas.

#### _Presentations_

In some class periods, you may be assigned to give a short presentation.  These presentations will be part of your grade and you are expected to be in class at the designated class time for your presentation. You must notify me before the end of the class period you are scheduled to present if there is an issue that prevented you from presenting that day.

#### _Duplication with CLIM680_

There is some duplication in the beginning of this course with CLIM 680 to make sure that all students are comfortable with required Unix and programming skills.  These knowledge and skills vary widely among students, are critical, and are not typically directly taught, thus the need for duplication.  The class periods that are duplicate are indicated in the course schedule.  Students who are in CLIM 680 may skip any duplicate lessons, but are encouraged to attend as helpers to assist other students with this material.  Helping others will help you to cement your knowledge.

### How will you be graded?

Your grade will consist of 50% _homework assignments_ and 50% your _final project_ and calculated as follows:

* Homework Assignments: 50%
* Final Project: 50% (25% written paper; 25% presentation)

#### _Assignments_
There will be 5 graded assignments throughout the course that require you to perform and/or analyze model experiments.  
Assignments will be submitted to Blackboard unless otherwise specified.
Assignments will be graded as satisfactory (A), not satisfactory (C), or not/minimally attempted (F) promptly after the due date. Feedback will be provided via Canvas.

If the assignment is graded not satisfactory or not attempted, you may redo the assignment until it is satisfactory until the last day of class (May 5). You must notify me if you wish me to re-grade a re-submitted assignment. It is your responsibility to complete all assignments by the last day of class.

#### _Final Project_
You are also expected to complete a project with a written paper and give a presentation in class of your project. Project details will be provided in class and posted on Blackboard.

#### _Exams_
This class has no exams.
