### Meeting Days/Times

Tues @ 10:30-13:10 by Zoom [ Registered students will receive a Zoom invitation ]
The class period is divided into two parts: 10:30 to 11:40 and Noon to 1:10.  Each part will start promptly.

### How will this class work in Zoom?

* You will receive a recurring Zoom invitation for this class that will contain the link.
* If your bandwidth allows and you are comfortable doing so, please leave your camera on. I will aim to do the same.
* Please mute if you are not speaking. I will mute you if there is significant background noise.
* I highly encourage interactions, questions, discussion, etc. It can be difficult in an online environment to make sure everyone gets the opportunity to speak.  To encourage interactions and make it easy for everyone to interact, if you wish to speak, please use one of the following methods:
* raise your hand using the Zoom hand raise feature,
   * type in the shared document (link will be provided),
   * type in the Zoom chat window
* I will attempt to monitor each of these and acknowledge people in the order in which they requested to speak.
* IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CLASS WILL BE RECORDED.  Videos may be used in other GMU courses or video snippets may be used in public forum (e.g. website, twitter, etc.) as an example or advertisement of online course instruction. If you have privacy concerns, please speak to me ASAP.
* Please be patient with technical issues as we all learn how best to do online learning via Zoom and to the best we can with our personal home internt.  Your feedback however is also welcome and encouraged.  See Feedback section below.

### Overview

An Earth system model is composed of models simulating the evolution of the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, biosphere, and other components. Course introduces the component models, their interactions, and how they are used to predict the behavior of weather and climate on time scales that range from hours to centuries. Students will learn technical and scientific skills necessary to run an Earth system model and evaluate its output.

_At the end of this course,learners will be able to:_
* Design and Run Earth System Model experiments for hypothesis driven research
* Identify different types of experiments from Earth System models and what they can tell us
* Analyze the output of an Earth System Model appropriately for a given type of experiment
* Utilize a high-performance computing system for performing Earth System Model experiments
* Use an Earth System model in their research

### Class Attendance

This is a synchronous, online course which means that it meets regularly online at a specified day and time. It is in your best interest to attend class during the scheduled class time.

_Live Coding_: One of the reasons you should attend class in person is that this class will utilize a methodology called “Live Coding”.  This means you will follow along with me while I share and write code on the screen and explain the code as I go.  There will be no powerpoint presentations. This method is shown to be effective because it slows down the pace so everyone can keep up, forces me to take the time to explain what I am doing, helps you get accustomed to running codes yourself on your computer setup, and lets you see me make mistakes and how to correct them.

#### _If you miss class_

I understand, however that there can be various reasons for missing class and that connectivity issues do occur.  If you miss class for whatever reason, all the information will be available to you on the course Blackboard site, including:
* Class materials, including hands-on activities, which are publicly available via Github (link will be provided in Blackboard).
* Classes will be recorded in Zoom, and the video posted to Blackboard.
* A shard OneDrive document will show information from each class period, including questions asked and links to additional reference information discussed in class. The link to the OneDrive document will be provided in Blackboard.
* All assignments will be posted to Blackboard.

#### _Presentations_

In some class periods, you may be assigned to give a short presentation.  These presentations will be part of your grade and you are expected to be in class at the designated class time for your presentation. You must notify me before the end of the class period you are scheduled to present if there is a connectivity issue that prevented you from presenting that day.

#### _Duplication with CLIM680_

There is some duplication in the beginning of this course with CLIM 680 to make sure that all students are comfortable with required Unix and programming skills.  These knowledge and skills vary widely among students, are critical, and are not typically directly taught, thus the need for duplication.  The class periods that are duplicate are indicated in the course schedule.  Students who are in CLIM 680 may skip any duplicate lessons, but are encouraged to attend as helpers to assist other students with this material.  Helping others will help you to cement your knowledge.

### Continuity Plans

Given the current times, there are constant changes and new University guidance regarding University operations.  There is also the possibility that a student, instructor, or family member that they care for may become ill and alternate arragements will need to be made.

We will follow all University guidance.  Typically I learn official University guidance at the same time as you.  I will promptly follow up with you via email and MS Teams about how the latest guidance impacts this class.

In the event that you as a student are unable to continue with the course, please notify me immediately so that we can discuss your options.  In the event that I as the Instructor am unable to continue teaching this course, it will continue as planned at the same day/time with a backup instructor.

### How will you be graded?

Your grade will consiste of 50% _homework assignments_ and 50% your _final project_ and calculated as follows:

* Homework Assignments: 50%
* Final Project: 50% (25% written paper; 25% presentation)

#### _Assignments_
Assignments are provided throughout the course weeks that require you to perform an analyze model experiments as we learn how to do them in class.  

Assignments will be graded as satisfactory (A), not satisfactory (C), or not/minimally attempted (F) promptly after the due date. Feedback will be provided via Blackboard or Github Issues.

If the assignment is graded not satisfactory or not attempted, you may redo the assignment until it is satisfactory until the last day of class (Dec 1). You must notify me if you wish me to re-grade a re-submitted assignment.

#### _Final Project_
You are also expected to complete a project with a written paper and give a presentation in class of your project. Project details will be provided in class and posted on Blackboard.

#### _Exams_
This class has no exams.

### Feedback

When teaching online, it can be more difficult for me to gauge student understanding than in person.  In person, I can usually see on a student’s face whether they understand something or not.  This is much more difficult in an online environment.  Additionally, I am consistently working to make my online courses as engaging and effective as possible.  Feedback will be regularly requested at the end of each class period and provide information to adapt the course throughout the semester for this specific class. Additionally, a post course survey will provided to get your overall feedback on the course separate from standard course evaluations which do not provide sufficient useful information for improving the course.  Please help to develop this course by providing feedback so that the course can improve and adapt.
